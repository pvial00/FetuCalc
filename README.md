# FetuCalc

FTU or Fetu is a mathematical system, developed by KryptoMagick (Uvajda), inspired from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Roman Alphabet.  It incorporates the thought that any sequence together as a whole is plus one the length of the sequence.  Every word in Fetu becomes a series of number sequences.
