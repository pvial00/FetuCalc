# FetuCalc

FTU or Fetu is a mathematical system, developed by KryptoMagick (Uvajda), inspired from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Roman Alphabet.  It incorporates the thought that any sequence together as a whole is plus one the length of the sequence.  Every word in Fetu becomes a series of number sequences.

Advanced Fetu Features allow text or documents to be easily fingerprinted as well as expose Fetu Cryptographic Properties for a given document.  Fetu Cryptographic Properties are derived from the Slip Public Key Algorithm (Diffie-Hellman variant)

Fetu can be used for any number of purposes such as statistical analysis, magic (Numerical Heka), cataloging and more.
