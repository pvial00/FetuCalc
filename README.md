# FetuCalc

FTU or Fetu is a mathematical system, developed by KryptoMagick (Uvajda), inspired from ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs and the Roman Alphabet.  It incorporates the thought that any sequence together as a whole is plus one the length of the sequence.  Every word in Fetu becomes a series of number sequences.

- FTU Sequences

0. Word
1. FTU
2. Dbl
3. Tri
4. Qua
5. FTU Value
6. FTU Weight
7. FTU Residue

A Fetu HWord or hieroword is a binary representation of Fetu features of the word.

- HWord Sequences

0. Word FTU modulo 2
1. Word FTU + Word FTU Value modulo 2
